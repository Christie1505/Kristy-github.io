    <h1> Ingredients </h1>
    <p> 3 cups sifted cake flour</p1>

      <p>2 ½ teaspoons baking powder</p1>
        
        <p>½ teaspoon salt</p1>
        
        <p>1 ¾ cups white sugar</p1>
        
        <p>⅔ cup butter, softened</p1>
        
        <p>2 large eggs</p1>
        
        <p>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</p1>
        
        <p>1 teaspoon grated grapefruit zest</p1>
        
        <p>¾ cup milk</p1>
        
        <p>½ cup fresh grapefruit juice</p1>

        <p> Directions</p1>

            <p> Step 1</p1>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
                    (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two (9-inch) pans.</p1>

                    <p> Step 2</p1>

                        <p>Sift together flour, baking powder
                            and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside.</p1>


                            <p>Step 3</p1>

                                <p>Cream together sugar and butter in a large bowl 
                                    with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.
                                    Beat in eggs one at a time, mixing well 
                                    after each addition. Stir in vanilla and grapefruit zest.
                                    Add flour mixture alternately with milk and grapefruit juice, beating briefly
                                    after each addition. Pour batter  into the prepared pans.</p1>

                                    <p>step 4</p1>
                                        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center
                                            of the cakes comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.  Let cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire 
                                            rack to cool completely.</p1>
